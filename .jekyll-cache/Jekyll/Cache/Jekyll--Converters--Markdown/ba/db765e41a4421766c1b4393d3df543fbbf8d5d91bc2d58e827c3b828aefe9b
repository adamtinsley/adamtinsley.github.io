I"é<p>In 2022 Adam Tinsley decided to stop wasting time reading the news and scrolling through social media and actually do something important: acquire, document, and play every Super Nintendo game released for retail sale in North America.</p>

<p>Now I know what youâ€™re thinking. That sounds stunning and very brave. Heroic even. Am I a hero? Perhaps, but thatâ€™s not for me to say.</p>

<p>On these pages of the interweb I will document my quest. It wonâ€™t be easy and there will be no shortcuts. None of these multi-game carts or Johnny-come-lately classic mini editions. I will be fighting the masses to collect each and every original cart on e-bay.</p>

<p>Then, I will record the game play footage with my new Game Capture device that works about 65% of the time. The other times it quits unexpectedly or just doesnâ€™t save the video. You can watch this footage on my YouTube page or check back here and watch the list of linked games grow and grow.</p>

<p>Stay tuned fellow gamersâ€¦</p>
